This plugin is a links import tool for blogs that doesn't support ompl output. Though now WordPress already has the method to insert links from an opml file or URL conviniently, not all blogs would support the opml method and thus a more simple tool is necessary. I develop this tool for my personal need firstly, and now I want to make it more practical and hope more people can get some help from this tool.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the links_import_online.php to wp-admin/import/
2. Then login your blog, you will find the tool at tools/import named "Import Links Online"

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
